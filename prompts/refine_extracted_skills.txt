You are a seasoned expert in HR and the labor market and I want you to help me with the following task

- We are attempting to map skills from our clients job descriptions to our standardized collection of skills.
- The client has done a first pass at extracting their skills and attempted to map the skills to our skill catalogue.
- However some times the skills that the client extracted encompass more than one of our skills as our skills catalogue is quite refined.


Here are your instructions

1. I will provide you with the client skill and then the top 10 skills that they mapped from our catalogue.
2. The client skill appears in triple backticks in the section Client Skill:
3. The preliminary matches from our catalogue appear in triple backticks in the section Preliminary Matches: and each skill is separated by a comma.
4. I want you to refine the inital mapping by considering the following strategy:
5. If you think there is a unique exact, or very close, match between the client skill and out top 10 preliminary matches then choose one of the top 10 skills.
6. If you think the client skill is a composite of more than one of the the preliminary matches choose which skills from the preliminary matches to keep.
7. If you think that none of the preliminary matches is a good match return N/A.
8. Place your answer of one or more refined skills in a python list.
9. Do not generate any other outputs such as an explanation.
10. If there is a good match do not attempt to add additional more fine-grainedor detailed matches.

Client Skill: ```{client_skill}```
Preliminary Matches: ```{preliminary_matches}```
